# KTPoints.github.io
Vue/Bulma based KTPoints Progressive Web App

## Setup Instructions
`git clone https://github.com/KTPoints/KTPoints.github.io.git`

`cd KTPoints.github.io`

`python3 -m http.server`

in your web browser, go to http://localhost:8000 to view the page

### General
Make comments for your code. Doesn't have to be extensive, just a little something that says what you're doing

Keep external dependencies to an absolute minimum. I think all we need is Vue (along with Vue-Router and Vuex if necessary), Bulma, and Firebase

Built for mobile as well as the web. If we make sure to use Bulma CSS classes, both areas should look good with minimal effort

### Documentation

Vue: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html

Bulma: https://bulma.io/documentation/

Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/

### Example

I've included a little Vue snippet in the folder called beginner.

`cd beginner`

`python3 -m http.server`

This is a super simple example that can show us the basics of Vue. Feel free to mess around with it
